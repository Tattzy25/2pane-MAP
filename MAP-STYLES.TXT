The Mapbox Styles API lets you read and change map styles, fonts, and images. This API is the basis for Mapbox Studio.

If you use Studio, Mapbox GL JS, or the Mapbox Mobile SDKs, you are already using the Styles API. This documentation is useful for software developers who want to programmatically read and write these resources. It isn't necessary for you to read or understand this reference to design or use Mapbox maps.

You will need to be familiar with the Mapbox Style Specification to use the Styles API. The Mapbox Style Specification defines the structure of map styles and is the open standard that helps Studio communicate with APIs and produce maps that are compatible with Mapbox libraries.

Mapbox styles
Mapbox Standard
Style name	Style URL	
Style image
Mapbox Standard	
mapbox://styles/mapbox/standard
Mapbox Standard
Mapbox Standard Satellite	
mapbox://styles/mapbox/standard-satellite
Mapbox Standard Satellite
To use Mapbox Standard or Mapbox Standard Satellite, you need to use GL JS v3 or newer on the web and on mobile Mobile Maps SDKs v11 or newer. Unless another style URL is specified, Mapbox Standard is the default map for these SDK versions.

The underlying paradigm to the Standard style is different from other Mapbox styles. Layers in Standard are not modifiable asides from the predefined configuration options. Mapbox manages the basemap experience and only surfaces key global styling configurations - in return, you get a carefully designed, cohesive visual experience and an evergreen map, always featuring the latest data, styling and rendering features compatible with your SDK.

To learn more, you can explore the Getting started docs.

Classic Mapbox styles (Legacy)
The following Mapbox-owned styles are no longer actively maintained, but prior map styles created with these classic templates will continue to be supported.

The style object
A style object is an object that conforms to the Mapbox Style Specification, with some additional account-related properties:

Property	Type	Description
version	number	The style specification version number.
name	string	A human-readable name for the style.
metadata	object	Information about the style that is used in Mapbox Studio.
sources	object	Sources supply the data that will be displayed on the map.
layers	array	Layers will be created in the order of this array.
created	string	The date and time the style was created.
id	string	The ID of the style.
modified	string	The date and time the style was last modified.
owner	string	The username of the style owner.
visibility	string	Access control for the style, either public or private. Private styles require an access token belonging to the owner. Public styles may be requested with an access token belonging to any user.
protected	boolean	Indicates whether the style is protected (true) or not (false). Protected styles cannot be edited and deleted.
draft	boolean	Indicates whether the style is a draft (true) or whether it has been published (false).
A style object must conform to the following rules:

Must be valid JSON
Must be aligned to the most recent version of the Mapbox Style Specification
Can be composed of no more than 15 sources
Cannot contain any keys in the body of the style beyond those listed in the Style Specification
The url property in the source object must be a valid Mapbox tileset ID
Only raster and vector sources are supported
You can use the gl-style-validate CLI tool with the --mapbox-api-supported flag to validate a style object. Invalid styles will produce a descriptive validation error.

Example style object
{
  "version": 8,
  "name": "{name}",
  "metadata": "{metadata}",
  "sources": "{sources}",
  "sprite": "mapbox://sprites/{username}/{style_id}",
  "glyphs": "mapbox://fonts/{username}/{fontstack}/{range}.pbf",
  "layers": ["{layers}"],
  "created": "2015-10-30T22:18:31.111Z",
  "id": "{style_id}",
  "modified": "2015-10-30T22:22:06.077Z",
  "owner": "{username}",
  "visibility": "private",
  "protected": false,
  "draft": true
}
Drafts
The Styles API supports drafts, so every style can have both published and draft versions. This means that you can make changes to a style without publishing them or deploying them in your app. For each style-related endpoint, you can interact with the draft version of a style by placing draft/ after the style ID, like /styles/v1/{username}/{style_id}/draft/sprite.

Note that the style you see in Studio's style editor is always the draft version. If you make changes to the published version of a style or sprite by calling the API without draft/ in the URI, those changes will not be reflected in the draft version.

Since styles are generally quite large, it's likely that a response to this endpoint will start paginating sooner than other list endpoints. If you have many styles in your account, you may need to repeatedly use the next link relation in the Link header of the response to retrieve them all.

Required parameter	Type	Description
username	string	The username of the account to which the styles belong.
You can further refine the results from this endpoint with the following optional parameters:

Optional parameters	Type	Description
draft	boolean	List only draft styles (true), or return all styles (false, default).
limit	integer	The maximum number of styles to return.
start	string	The ID of the style after which to start the listing. Find the style ID in the Link header of a response. See the pagination section for details.
Example request: List styles
curl "https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/YOUR_MAPBOX_USERNAME?access_token=YOUR_SECRET_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN"

Create a style
post
https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/{username}
styles:writetoken scope
Creates a style in your account. The posted style object must conform to the rules outlined in the style object section of this documentation. Invalid styles will produce a descriptive validation error.

Additionally, when you create a style using the Styles API:

The glyphs field will be overwritten to point to your user glyph endpoint, unless it's referring to the Mapbox glyph endpoint, mapbox://fonts/mapbox/{fontstack}/{range}.pbf.
If the sprite field does not include your username, and the sprite field points to the sprite of a style that either belongs to mapbox or is public, the Styles API will copy all images to the new style's spritesheet and overwrite the sprite value to point to the new style's sprite.
If the optional name property is not used in the request body, the name of the new style will be automatically set to the style's ID.
Required parameter	Type	Description
username	string	The username of the account to which the new style will belong.
Example request: Create a style
curl -X POST "https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/YOUR_MAPBOX_USERNAME?access_token=YOUR_SECRET_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN" \

Update a style
patch
https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/{username}/{style_id}
styles:writetoken scope
Updates an existing style in your account with new content. The request body must be a style object that conforms to the rules outlined in the style object section of this documentation. Invalid styles will produce a descriptive validation error.

Additionally, when you update a style using the Styles API:

The name property, which is optional for creating a style, is required in the request body to update a style.
If you request a style and then use the unaltered response to update the style, this action will fail. You must remove the created and modified properties before updating a style.
The glyphs field will be overwritten to point to your user glyph endpoint, unless it's referring to the Mapbox glyph endpoint, mapbox://fonts/mapbox/{fontstack}/{range}.pbf.
If the sprite field does not include your username, and the sprite field points to the sprite of a style that either belongs to mapbox or is public, the Styles API will copy all images to the updated style's spritesheet and overwrite the sprite value to point to the updated style's sprite.
Cross-version PATCH requests are rejected.

Response: Retrieve a map's WMTS document
The response to a request to this endpoint will be a map's WMTS document.

Sprites
Sprites are the way that Mapbox GL JS and the Mapbox mobile SDKs efficiently request and show images. Sprites are collections of images that can be used in styles as icons or patterns in symbol layers. An image in a sprite can be an icon, a pattern, or an illustration. These SVG images can be added and removed from the sprite at will. The Styles API automatically collects these SVG images and renders them into a single PNG image and a JSON document that describes where each image is positioned.

The sprite JSON document is specified as part of the Mapbox Style Specification.

Sprites are managed on a per-style basis. Each sprite belongs to a style, so the sprite limit of 1,000 images is also a per-style limit.

Sprite images are PNG-8 files that are optimized to have a limited color palette. Usually, visual differences from the source SVG files are not noticeable but you may in some cases notice slight changes in colors or dithering when inspecting sprite images closely.

All sprite-related API methods require a {style_id} parameter that refers to the style to which the sprite belongs.

Retrieve a sprite image or JSON
get
https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/{username}/{style_id}/{sprite_id}/sprite{@2x}.{format}
styles:readtoken scope
Retrieve a sprite image or its JSON document from a Mapbox style.

Required parameters	Type	Description
username	string	The username of the account to which the style belongs.
style_id	string	The ID of the style to which the sprite belongs.
You can further refine the results from this endpoint with the following optional parameters:

Optional parameters	Type	Description
sprite_id	string	The ID of the immutable sprite. To learn how to find a sprite's unique ID, see the How to retrieve a sprite ID section.
@2x	string	Render the sprite at a @2x, @3x, or @4x scale factor for high-density displays. Decimal values such as @2.5x are also supported.
format	string	By default, this endpoint returns a sprite's JSON document. Specify .png to return the sprite image instead.
Example request: Retrieve a sprite image or JSON
# Request the sprite image as a png

Response: Retrieve a sprite image or JSON
The response to a successful request to this endpoint is either a sprite image or its JSON response, depending on which was requested.

Example response: Retrieve a sprite image or JSON
{
  "default_marker": {
    "width": 20,
    "height": 50,
    "x": 0,
    "y": 0,
    "pixelRatio": 2
  },
  "secondary_marker": {
    "width": 20,
    "height": 50,
    "x": 20,
    "y": 0,
    "pixelRatio": 2
  }
}
How to retrieve a sprite ID
Because sprites tend to stay static for long durations, we offer immutable sprites with unique URLs. This allows us to have long cache durations resulting in faster load times. This also prevents styles from breaking if the sprites are updated "beneath" them. These unique URLs are possible because of the sprite_id that can be placed in the URL.

After you have uploaded your sprite images using the Add new image to sprite endpoint or the Add multiple new images to sprite endpoint, make a request to update your style. The response payload for the style update will contain the unique sprite URL on the sprite payload.

Note: Mapbox Studio does all this work for you automatically.
